  - after fermenting, the clear sake is pressed out of the mash mixture. This is
    usually done by a machine, but traditionally a sakebune was used, which is
    simply a box with a hole at the bottom, and a lid.  The lid is pushed down on
    bags of mash, and the clear sake runs out the hole.
is_shiboritate: 1 if the sake is shiboritate
  - shiboritate means 'freshly pressed,' and it sake that has just been pressed
    after fermenting, without being pasteurized, filtered, aged, diluted, or

  grade (futsu-shu, junmai-shu, daiginjo-shu, etc.)
